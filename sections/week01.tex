% CHANGE 1: Use \chapter instead of \section* % This puts "Week 1" in the Table of Contents and starts a new page.
\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:week1}

\section{Task Outline}
The goal was to toggle an LED using direct register access.
I chose a polling architecture for simplicity, though this blocks the CPU.

\section{Implementation}
Below is some example code that demonstrates how to embed C code in LaTeX using the listings package.

% Import the C code
% Ensure the path matches your actual file structure
\lstinputlisting[language=C, caption={LED Driver Code}]{src/week-01/example.c}

\section{Reflections}
Direct memory access is faster but riskier than using an abstraction layer. 
In the future, I would wrap this in a macro to improve readability.
